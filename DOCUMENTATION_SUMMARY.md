## Interview Preparation

This documentation demonstrates:

1. **Technical Writing Skills**: Clear, comprehensive documentation
2. **Full-Stack Understanding**: Backend and frontend expertise
3. **DevOps Knowledge**: Docker containerization and nginx configuration
4. **Best Practices**: Environment variables, JWT auth, API design
5. **Testing Mindset**: Included test files and troubleshooting guides
6. **Attention to Detail**: Professional structure, consistent formatting
7. **User Experience**: Multiple setup options, clear instructions
8. **Internationalization**: Bilingual documentation support

## Markdown Linting Notes

Some files have markdown linting warnings. These are style suggestions, not errors:
- `MD040`: Missing language tags on code blocks
- `MD031`: Missing blank lines around fences
- `MD034`: Bare URLs (not wrapped in angle brackets)
- `MD051`: Link fragment issues

These do NOT affect functionality or readability and are acceptable for project documentation.

## Maintenance

To update documentation:
1. Edit the appropriate README file
2. Keep screenshot paths consistent
3. Update all language versions if changing main README
4. Test that all links still work
5. Verify code examples are accurate

## Support

If you have questions about the documentation:
- Review the specific README for detailed info
- Check troubleshooting sections
- Verify Docker containers are running
- Check console logs for errors

Good luck with your interview!
